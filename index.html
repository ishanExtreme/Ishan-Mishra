Through this project our aim is to motivate and educate citizens to throw waste in garbage containers. We aim to achieve this goal through a mobile APP which will give the nearest dustbin location to the user, and also a leaderboard system for contributing the location of dustbins, not only this we are also giving the feature of rating the dustbins based on how clean it is, through this data of ratings we can rate an entire area on its cleanliness. For example a user wants to buy a new house he/she can check the rating of the cleanliness of that area before buying.","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishanExtreme/Ishan-Mishra/master/assets/images/dustbinz.png","tags":["ReactNative","GoogleAPIs","Express","MongoDB"],"links":["https://github.com/ishanExtreme/DustBinz","https://devfolio.co/projects/dustbinz-c6cb"]},{"title":"Real Time Truth, Dare & Stare","description":"Due to corona and lock down in many countries we are facing a serious mental health issues, specially the students who at this time enjoy the summer vacations with their friends are locked inside their houses.

But all these fails when it comes to keeping the data private, it’s always on the news that about the user data being leaked. Although this may not be a problem for many users as they consider themself an “Open Book” but few who want to keep their life private wants a better solution to this. From our small project we are trying to contribute towards this goal.","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishanExtreme/Ishan-Mishra/master/assets/images/extreme_chat.png","tags":["Java","Socket Programming","Java Swing"],"links":["https://github.com/ishanExtreme/Extreme-Chat"]},{"title":"Eagle-AI-GUI","description":"This project visualizes the effect of changing different hyper-parameters on Deep Neural\nNetworks, Lenear Regression and Logistic Regression algorithms using matplotlib.","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishanExtreme/Ishan-Mishra/master/assets/images/eagle-ai.png","tags":["Deep Learning","Tkinter","Python","Deep Neural Network"],"links":["https://github.com/ishanExtreme/Eagle-AI-GUI"]},{"title":"Bulk-Email-Sender","description":"This Application can be used to send emails using gmail id with attachements to a list of people by just one click.\nIt uses fail_stack to store the emails with unsuccessful send.\nThus if internet connection fails in between the process, than process can be restarted when connection restores.\nRealtime notification panel to give all the updates about email sending process.\n","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishanExtreme/Ishan-Mishra/master/assets/images/email_sender.jpeg","tags":["Tkinter","Python","SMTP"],"links":["https://github.com/ishanExtreme/Bulk-Email-Sender"]}],"repositories":["ishanExtreme/Superman"]}
